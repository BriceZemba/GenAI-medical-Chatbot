This encyclopedia avoids\\nmedical jargon and uses language that laypersons\\ncan understand, while still providing thorough cover-\\nage of each topic. TheGale Encyclopedia of Medicine 3\\nfills a gap between basic consumer health resources,\\nsuch as single-volume family medical guides, and\\nhighly technical professional materials.\\nSCOPE\\nMore than 1,750 full-length articles are included\\nin theGale Encyclopedia of Medicine 3, including dis-\\norders/conditions, tests/procedures, and treatments/\\ntherapies. Many common drugs are also covered,\\nwith generic drug names appearing first and brand\\nnames following in parentheses, eg. acetaminophen\\n(Tylenol). Throughout the Gale Encyclopedia of\\nMedicine 3, many prominent individuals are high-\\nlighted as sidebar biographies that accompany the\\nmain topical essays. Articles follow a standardized\\nformat that provides information at a glance.\\nRubrics include:\\nDisorders/Conditions Tests/Treatments\\nDefinition Definition\\nDescription Purpose\\nCauses and symptoms Precautions\\nDiagnosis Description\\nTreatment Preparation\\nAlternative treatment Aftercare\\nPrognosis Risks\\nPrevention Normal/Abnormal results\\nResources Resources\\nKey terms Key terms\\nIn recent years there has been a resurgence of\\ninterest in holistic medicine that emphasizes the\\nconnection between mind and body. Aimed at achiev-\\ning and maintaining good health rather than just elim-\\ninating disease, this approach has come to be known\\nas alternative medicine. TheGale Encyclopedia of\\nMedicine 3 includes a number of essays on alterna-\\ntive therapies, ranging from traditional Chinese\\nmedicine to homeopathy and from meditation\\nto aromatherapy. In addition to full essays on alter-\\nnative therapies, the encyclopedia features specific\\nAlternative treatment sections for diseases and con-\\nditions that may be help ed by complementary\\ntherapies.\\nINCLUSION CRITERIA\\nA preliminary list of diseases, disorders, tests\\nand treatments was compiled from a wide variety of\\nsources, including professional medical guides and\\ntextbooks as well as consumer guides and encyclope-\\ndias. The general advisory board, made up of public\\nlibrarians, medical librarians and consumer health\\nexperts, evaluated the topics and made suggestions\\nfor inclusion. The list was sorted by category and\\nsent toGEM3 medical advisers, for review. Final selec-\\ntion of topics to include was made by the medical\\nadvisors in conjunction with the Thomson Gale\\neditor.\\nABOUT THE CONTRIBUTORS\\nThe essays were compiled by experienced medical\\nwriters, including physicians, pharmacists, nurses,\\nand other health care professionals.GEM3 medical\\nadvisors reviewed the completed essays to insure\\nthat they are appropriate, up-to-date, and medically\\naccurate.\\nHOW TO USE THIS BOOK\\nThe Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine 3 has been\\ndesigned with ready reference in mind.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE xxi'),\n",

A trans-\\nmitter sends high frequency sound waves into the body,\\nwhere they bounce off the different tissues and organs\\nto produce a distinctive pattern of echoes. A receiver\\n‘‘hears’’ the returning echo pattern and forwards it to a\\ncomputer, which translates the data into an image on a\\ntelevision screen. Because ultrasound can distinguish\\nsubtle variations between soft, fluid-filled tissues, it is\\nparticularly useful in providing diagnostic images of the\\nabdomen. Ultrasound can also be used in treatment.\\nPurpose\\nThe potential medical applications of ultrasound\\nwere first recognized in the 1940s as an outgrowth of\\nthe sonar technology developed to detect submarines\\nduring World War II. The first useful medical images\\nwere produced in the early 1950s, and, by 1965, ultra-\\nsound quality had improved to the point that it came\\ninto general medical use. Improvements in the tech-\\nnology, application, and interpretation of ultrasound\\ncontinue. Its low cost, versatility, safety and speed\\nhave brought it into the top drawer of medical imaging\\ntechniques.\\nWhile pelvic ultrasoundis widely known and com-\\nmonly used for fetal monitoring duringpregnancy,\\nultrasound is also routinely used for general abdom-\\ninal imaging. It has great advantage over x-ray ima-\\nging technologies in that it does not damage tissues\\nwith ionizing radiation. Ultrasound is also generally\\nfar better than plain x rays at distinguishing the subtle\\nvariations of soft tissue structures, and can be used in\\nany of several modes, depending on the need at hand.\\nAs an imaging tool, abdominal ultrasound gener-\\nally is warranted for patients afflicted with: chronic or\\nacute abdominalpain; abdominal trauma; an obvious\\nor suspected abdominal mass; symptoms ofliver dis-\\nease, pancreatic disease,gallstones, spleen disease,kid-\\nney diseaseand urinary blockage; or symptoms of an\\nabdominal aortic aneurysm. Specifically:\\n/C15Abdominal pain. Whether acute or chronic, pain can\\nsignal a serious problem–from organ malfunction or\\ninjury to the presence of malignant growths.\\nUltrasound scanning can help doctors quickly sort\\nthrough potential causes when presented with gen-\\neral or ambiguous symptoms. All of the major\\nabdominal organs can be studied for signs of disease\\nthat appear as changes in size, shape and internal\\nstructure.\\n/C15Abdominal trauma. After a serious accident, such as\\na car crash or a fall, internal bleeding from injured\\nabdominal organs is often the most serious threat to\\nsurvival. Neither the injuries nor the bleeding are\\nimmediately apparent. Ultrasound is very useful as\\nan initial scan when abdominal trauma is suspected,\\nand it can be used to pinpoint the location, cause,\\nand severity of hemorrhaging. In the case of punc-\\nturewounds, from a bullet for example, ultrasound\\ncan locate the foreign object and provide a prelimin-\\nary survey of the damage. The easy portability and\\nversatility of ultrasound technology has brought it\\ninto common emergency room use, and even into\\nlimited ambulance service.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 1'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'page': 31}, page_content='/C15Abdominal mass. Abnormal growths–tumors, cysts,\\nabscesses, scar tissue and accessory organs–can be\\nlocated and tentatively identified with ultrasound. In\\nparticular, potentially malignant solid tumors can be\\ndistinguished from benign fluid-filled cysts and\\nabscesses. Masses and malformations in any organ\\nor part of the abdomen can be found.\\n/C15Liver disease. The types and underlying causes of\\nliver disease are numerous, though jaundice tends\\nto be a general symptom. Ultrasound can differenti-\\nate between many of the types and causes of liver\\nmalfunction, and is particularly good at identifying\\nobstruction of the bile ducts andcirrhosis, which is\\ncharacterized by abnormal fibrous growths and\\nreduced blood flow.\\n/C15Pancreatic disease. Inflammation and malformation\\nof the pancreas are readily identified by ultrasound,\\nas are pancreatic stones (calculi), which can disrupt\\nproper functioning.\\n/C15Gallstones. Gallstones cause morehospital admissions\\nthan any other digestive malady. These calculi can\\ncause painful inflammation of the gallbladder and\\nalso obstruct the bile ducts that carry digestive enzymes\\nfrom the gallbladder and liver to the intestines.\\nGallstones are readily identifiable with ultrasound.\\n/C15Spleen disease. The spleen is particularly prone to\\ninjury during abdominal trauma. It may also become\\npainfully inflamed when beset with infection or\\ncancer. These conditions also lend themselves well\\nto ultrasonic inspection and diagnosis.\\n/C15Kidney disease. The kidneys are also prone to trau-\\nmatic injury and are the organs most likely to form\\ncalculi, which can block the flow of urine and cause\\nbloodpoisoning(uremia). A variety of diseases causing\\ndistinct changes in kidney morphology can also lead to\\ncomplete kidney failure. Ultrasound imaging has pro-\\nven extremely useful in diagnosing kidney disorders.\\n/C15Abdominal aortic aneurysm. This is a bulging weak\\nspot in the abdominal aorta, which supplies blood\\ndirectly from the heart to the entire lower body.\\nThese aneurysms are relatively common and increase\\nin prevalence with age. A burst aortic aneurysm is\\nimminently life-threatening. However, they can be\\nreadily identified and monitored with ultrasound\\nbefore acute complications result.\\nUltrasound technology can also be used for treat-\\nment purposes, most frequently as a visual aid during\\nsurgical procedures–such as guiding needle placement\\nto drain fluid from a cyst, or to extract tumor cells for\\nbiopsy. Increasingly, direct therapeutic applications\\nfor ultrasound are being developed.\\nThe direct therapeutic value of ultrasonic waves\\nlies in their mechanical nature. They are shock waves,\\njust like audible sound, and vibrate the materials\\nthrough which they pass. These vibrations are mild,\\nvirtually unnoticeable at the frequencies and intensi-\\nties used for imaging. Properly focused however, high-\\nintensity ultrasound can be used to heat and physically\\nagitate targeted tissues.\\nHigh-intensity ultrasound is used routinely to treat\\nsoft tissue injuries, such asstrains,t e a r sa n da s s o c i a t e d\\nscarring. The heating and agitation are believed to\\npromote rapid healing through increased circulation.\\nStrongly focused, high-intensity, high-frequency ultra-\\nsound can also be used to physically destroy certain\\ntypes of tumors, as well as gallstones and other types\\nof calculi. Developing new treatment applications\\nfor ultrasound is an active area of medical research.\\nPrecautions\\nProperly performed, ultrasound imaging is vir-\\ntually without risk or side effects. Some patients report\\nfeeling a slighttingling and/or warmth while being\\nscanned, but most feel nothing at all. Ultrasound\\nwaves of appropriate frequency and intensity are not\\nknown to cause or aggravate any medical condition,\\nthough any woman who thinks she might be pregnant\\nshould raise the issue with her doctor before under-\\ngoing an abdominal ultrasound.\\nThe value of ultrasound imaging as a medical tool,\\nhowever, depends greatly on the quality of the equip-\\nment used and the skill of the medical personnel oper-\\nating it. Improperly performed and/or interpreted,\\nultrasound can be worse than useless if it indicates\\nthat a problem exists where there is none, or fails to\\ndetect a significant condition. Basic ultrasound equip-\\nment is relatively inexpensive to obtain, and any doc-\\ntor with the equipment can perform the procedure\\nwhether qualified or not. Patients should not hesitate\\nto verify the credentials of technicians and doctors\\nperforming ultrasounds, as well as the quality of the\\nequipment used and the benefits of the proposed\\nprocedure.\\nIn cases where ultrasound is used as a treatment\\ntool, patients should educate themselves about the\\nproposed procedure with the help of their doctors–as\\nis appropriate before any surgical procedure. Also,\\nany abdominal ultrasound procedure, diagnostic or\\ntherapeutic, may be hampered by a patient’s body\\ntype or other factors, such as the presence of excessive\\nbowel gas (which is opaque to ultrasound). In parti-\\ncular, very obese people are often not good candidates\\nfor abdominal ultrasound.\\n2 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAbdominal ultrasound'),\n",

Medical ultrasound gener-\\nally uses frequencies between one and 10 million hertz\\n(1-10 MHz). Higher frequency ultrasound waves pro-\\nduce more detailed images, but are also more readily\\nabsorbed and so cannot penetrate as deeply into the\\nbody. Abdominal ultrasound imaging is generally per-\\nformed at frequencies between 2-5 MHz.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAccessory organ— A lump of tissue adjacent to an\\norgan that is similar to it, but which serves no impor-\\ntant purpose, if functional at all. While not necessa-\\nrily harmful, such organs can cause problems if they\\ngrow too large or become cancerous. In any case,\\ntheir presence points to an underlying abnormality in\\nthe parent organ.\\nBenign— In medical usage, benign is the opposite of\\nmalignant. It describes an abnormal growth that is\\nstable, treatable and generally not life-threatening.\\nBiopsy— The surgical removal and analysis of a\\ntissue sample for diagnostic purposes. Usually, the\\nterm refers to the collection and analysis of tissue\\nfrom a suspected tumor to establish malignancy.\\nCalculus— Any type of hard concretion (stone) in the\\nbody, but usually found in the gallbladder, pancreas\\nand kidneys. They are formed by the accumulation of\\nexcess mineral salts and other organic material such\\nas blood or mucous. Calculi (pl.) can cause problems\\nby lodging in and obstructing the proper flow of fluids,\\nsuch as bile to the intestines or urine to the bladder.\\nCirrhosis— A chronic liver disease characterized by\\nthe invasion of connective tissue and the degenera-\\ntion of proper functioning–jaundice is often an\\naccompanying symptom. Causes of cirrhosis include\\nalcoholism, metabolic diseases, syphilis and conges-\\ntive heart disease.\\nCommon bile duct— The branching passage through\\nwhich bile–a necessary digestive enzyme–travels\\nfrom the liver and gallbladder into the small intes-\\ntine. Digestive enzymes from the pancreas also enter\\nthe intestines through the common bile duct.\\nComputed tomography scan (CT scan)— As p e c i a -\\nlized type of x-ray imaging that uses highly focused\\nand relatively low energy radiation to produce detailed\\ntwo-dimensional images of soft tissue structures, parti-\\ncularly the brain. CT scans are the chief competitor to\\nultrasound and can yield higher quality images not\\nd i s r u p t e db yb o n eo rg a s .T h e ya r e ,h o w e v e r ,m o r e\\ncumbersome, time consuming and expensive to per-\\nform, and they use ionizing electromagnetic radiation.\\nDoppler— The Doppler effect refers to the apparent\\nchange in frequency of sound wave echoes returning\\nto a stationary source from a moving target. If the\\nobject is moving toward the source, the frequency\\nincreases; if the object is moving away, the fre-\\nquency decreases. The size of this frequency shift\\ncan be used to compute the object’s speed–be it a\\ncar on the road or blood in an artery. The Doppler\\neffect holds true for all types of radiation, not just\\nsound.\\nFrequency— Sound, whether traveling through air or\\nthe human body, produces vibrations–molecules\\nbouncing into each other–as the shock wave travels\\nalong. The frequency of a sound is the number of\\nvibrations per second. Within the audible range,\\nfrequency means pitch–the higher the frequency,\\nthe higher a sound’s pitch.\\nIonizing radiation— Radiation that can damage liv-\\ning tissue by disrupting and destroying individual\\ncells at the molecular level. All types of nuclear\\nradiation–x rays, gamma rays and beta rays–are\\npotentially ionizing. Sound waves physically vibrate\\nthe material through which they pass, but do not\\nionize it.\\nJaundice— A condition that results in a yellow tint to\\nthe skin, eyes and body fluids. Bile retention in the\\nliver, gallbladder and pancreas is the immediate\\ncause, but the underlying cause could be as simple\\nas obstruction of the common bile duct by a gall-\\nstone or as serious as pancreatic cancer. Ultrasound\\ncan distinguish between these conditions.\\nMalignant— The term literally means growing worse\\nand resisting treatment. It is used as a synonym for\\ncancerous and connotes a harmful condition that\\ngenerally is life-threatening.\\nMorphology— Literally, the study of form. In medi-\\ncine, morphology refers to the size, shape and struc-\\nture rather than the function of a given organ. As a\\ndiagnostic imaging technique, ultrasound facilitates\\nthe recognition of abnormal morphologies as symp-\\ntoms of underlying conditions.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 3\\nAbdominal ultrasound'),\n",

The transducer both pro-\\nduces the sound waves that penetrate the body and\\nreceives the reflected echoes. Transducers are built\\naround piezoelectric ceramic chips. (Piezoelectric\\nrefers to electricity that is produced when you put\\npressure on certain crystals such as quartz). These\\nceramic chips react to electric pulses by producing\\nsound waves ( they are transmitting waves) and react\\nto sound waves by producing electric pulses (receiv-\\ning). Bursts of high frequency electric pulses supplied\\nto the transducer causes it to produce the scanning\\nsound waves. The transducer then receives the return-\\ning echoes, translates them back into electric pulses\\nand sends them to the analyzer–a computer that orga-\\nnizes the data into an image on a television screen.\\nBecause sound waves travel through all the body’s\\ntissues at nearly the same speed–about 3,400 miles per\\nhour–the microseconds it takes for each echo to be\\nreceived can be plotted on the screen as a distance into\\nthe body. The relative strength of each echo, a func-\\ntion of the specific tissue or organ boundary that\\nproduced it, can be plotted as a point of varying\\nbrightness. In this way, the echoes are translated into\\na picture. Tissues surrounded by bone or filled with\\ngas (the stomach, intestines and bowel) cannot be\\nimaged using ultrasound, because the waves are\\nblocked or become randomly scattered.\\nFour different modes of ultrasound are used in\\nmedical imaging:\\n/C15A-mode. This is the simplest type of ultrasound in\\nwhich a single transducer scans a line through the\\nbody with the echoes plotted on screen as a function\\nof depth. This method is used to measure distances\\nwithin the body and the size of internal organs.\\nTherapeutic ultrasound aimed at a specific tumor\\nor calculus is also A-mode, to allow for pinpoint\\naccurate focus of the destructive wave energy.\\n/C15B-mode. In B-mode ultrasound, a linear array of\\ntransducers simultaneously scans a plane through\\nthe body that can be viewed as a two-dimensional\\nimage on screen. Ultrasound probes containing more\\nthan 100 transducers in sequence form the basis for\\nthese most commonly used scanners, which cost\\nabout $50,000.\\n/C15M-Mode. The M stands for motion. A rapid\\nsequence of B-mode scans whose images follow\\neach other in sequence on screen enables doctors to\\nsee and measure range of motion, as the organ\\nboundaries that produce reflections move relative\\nto the probe. M-mode ultrasound has been put to\\nparticular use in studying heart motion.\\n/C15Doppler mode.Doppler ultrasonographyincludes the\\ncapability of accurately measuring velocities of mov-\\ning material, such as blood in arteries and veins. The\\nprinciple is the same as that used in radar guns that\\nmeasure the speed of a car on the highway. Doppler\\ncapability is most often combined with B-mode scan-\\nning to produce images of blood vessels from which\\nblood flow can be directly measured. This technique\\nis used extensively to investigate valve defects, arter-\\niosclerosis and hypertension, particularly in the\\nheart, but also in the abdominal aorta and the portal\\nvein of the liver. These machines cost about\\n$250,000.\\nThe actual procedure for a patient undergoing an\\nabdominal ultrasound is relatively simple, regardless\\nof the type of scan or its purpose.Fasting for at least\\neight hours prior to the procedure ensures that the\\nstomach is empty and as small as possible, and that\\nthe intestines and bowels are relatively inactive.\\nFasting also allows the gall bladder to be seen, as it\\ncontracts after eating and may not be seen if the sto-\\nmach is full. In some cases, a full bladder helps to push\\nintestinal folds out of the way so that the gas they\\ncontain does not disrupt the image. The patient’s\\nabdomen is then greased with a special gel that allows\\nthe ultrasound probe to glide easily across the skin\\nwhile transmitting and receiving ultrasonic pulses.\\nThis procedure is conducted by a doctor with the\\nassistance of a technologist skilled in operating the\\nequipment. The probe is moved around the abdomen\\nto obtain different views of the target areas. The\\npatient will likely be asked to change positions from\\nside to side and to hold their breath as necessary to\\nobtain the desired views. Discomfort during the pro-\\ncedure is minimal.\\nThe many types and uses of ultrasound technol-\\nogy makes it difficult to generalize about the time and\\ncosts involved. Relatively simple imaging–scanning a\\nsuspicious abdominal mass or a suspected abdominal\\naortic aneurysm–will take about half an hour to per-\\nform and will cost a few hundred dollars or more,\\ndepending on the quality of the equipment, the\\noperator and other factors. More involved techniques\\nsuch as multiple M-mode and Doppler-enhanced\\nscans, or cases where the targets not well defined in\\nadvance, generally take more time and are more\\nexpensive.\\nRegardless of the type of scan used and the potential\\ndifficulties encountered, ultrasound remains faster and\\nless expensive than computed tomography scans (CT),\\nits primary rival in abdominal imaging.

It occurs in a rare\\npercentage of pregnancies.\\nPurpose\\nPartial birth abortion, or D&X, is performed to\\nend a pregnancy and results in the death of a fetus,\\ntypically in the late second or third trimester.\\nAlthough D&X is highly controversial, some physi-\\ncians argue that it has advantages that make it a pre-\\nferable procedure in some circumstances. One\\nperceived advantage is that the fetus is removed\\nlargely intact, allowing for better evaluation and\\nautopsy of the fetus in cases of known fetal abnormal-\\nities. Intact removal of the fetus also may carry a lower\\nrisk of puncturing the uterus or damaging the cervix.\\nAnother perceived advantage is that D&X ends the\\npregnancy without requiring the woman to go\\nthrough labor, which may be less emotionally trau-\\nmatic than other methods of late-term abortion.

A con-\\ntroversy common to all late-term abortions is whether\\nthe fetus is viable, or able to survive outside of the\\nwoman’s body. A specific area of controversy with\\nD&X is that fetal death does not occur until after\\nmost of the fetal body has exited the uterus. Several\\nstates have taken legal action to limit or ban D&X and\\nmany physicians who perform abortions do not per-\\nform D&X. This may restrict the availability of this\\nprocedure to women seeking late-term abortions.\\nIn March 2003, the United States Senate passed a\\nbill banning partial birth abortions and implementing\\nfines or maximum two-year jail terms for physicians\\nwho perform them. In June 2003, the House approved\\na ban as well. President George W. Bush signed the\\nlegislation into law, but a federal judge declared the\\nlaw unconstitutional, so that the government had not\\nbeen able to enforce it. One of the opponents’ claims\\nwas the legislation did not provide for exceptions for\\ncases in which the procedure was needed to protect the\\nmother’s health.\\nDescription\\nIntact D&X, or partial birth abortion first\\ninvolves administration of medications to cause the\\ncervix to dilate, usually over the course of several\\ndays. Next, the physician rotates the fetus to a footling\\nbreech position. The body of the fetus is then drawn\\nout of the uterus feet first, until only the head remains\\ninside the uterus. Then, the physician uses an instru-\\nment to puncture the base of the skull, which collapses\\nthe fetal head. Typically, the contents of the fetal head\\nare then partially suctioned out, which results in the\\ndeath of the fetus and reduces the size of the fetal head\\nenough to allow it to pass through the cervix. The dead\\nand otherwise intact fetus is then removed from the\\nwoman’s body.\\nPreparation\\nMedical preparation for D&X involves an out-\\npatient visit to administer medications, such aslami-\\nnaria, to cause the cervix to begin dilating.\\nIn addition, preparation may involve fulfilling\\nlocal legal requirements, such as a mandatory waiting\\nperiod, counseling, or an informed consent procedure\\nreviewing stages of fetal development,childbirth, alter-\\nnative abortion methods, and adoption.\\nAftercare\\nD&X typically does not require an overnight hos-\\npital stay, so a follow up appointment may be sched-\\nuled to monitor the woman for any complications.\\nRisks\\nWith all abortion, the later in pregnancy an abor-\\ntion is performed, the more complicated the procedure\\nand the greater the risk of injury to the woman. In\\naddition to associated emotional reactions, D&X car-\\nries the risk of injury to the woman, including heavy\\nbleeding, blood clots, damage to the cervix or uterus,\\npelvic infection, and anesthesia-related complications.\\nThere also is a risk of incomplete abortion, meaning\\nthat the fetus is not dead when removed from the\\nwoman’s body. Possible long-term risks include diffi-\\nculty becoming pregnant or carrying a future preg-\\nnancy to term.\\nNormal results\\nThe expected outcome of D&X is the termination\\nof a pregnancy with removal of a dead fetus from the\\nwoman’s body.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\n‘‘Court Rules Abortion Ban Unconstitutional.’’Medicine &\\nHealth (June 7, 2004): 4–6.\\n‘‘House Approves Partial Birth Abortion Ban.’’Medicine\\nand Health (June 16, 2003): 5.\\n‘‘Partial-birth Abortion Ban Approved by Senate.’’Medical\\nEthics Advisor (April 2003): 47.\\nKEY TERMS\\nCervix— The narrow outer end of the uterus that\\nseparates the uterus from the vaginal canal.\\nFootling breech— A position of the fetus while in\\nthe uterus where the feet of the fetus are nearest the\\ncervix and will be the first part of the fetus to exit the\\nuterus, with the head of the fetus being the last part\\nto exit the uterus.\\nLaminaria— A medical product made from a cer-\\ntain type of seaweed that is physically placed near\\nthe cervix to cause it to dilate.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 7\\nAbortion, partial birth'),\n",

Odle\\nAbortion, selective\\nDefinition\\nSelective abortion, also known as selective reduc-\\ntion, refers to choosing to abort a fetus, typically in a\\nmulti-fetalpregnancy, to decrease the health risks to\\nthe mother in carrying and giving birth to more than\\none or two babies, and also to decrease the risk of\\ncomplications to the remaining fetus(es). The term\\nselective abortion also refers to choosing to abort a\\nfetus for reasons such as the woman is carrying a fetus\\nwhich likely will be born with some birth defect or\\nimpairment, or because the sex of the fetus is not\\npreferred by the individual.\\nPurpose\\nA woman may decide to abort for health reasons,\\nfor example, she is at higher risk for complications\\nduring pregnancy because of a disorder or disease\\nsuch as diabetes.

In this care,\\nselective abortion was successful at saving the mother\\nand the remaining embryos.\\nHowever, selective reduction is recommended\\noften in cases of multi-fetal pregnancy, or the presence\\nof more than one fetus, typically, at least three or more\\nfetuses. In the general population, multi-fetal preg-\\nnancy happens in only about 1-2% of pregnant\\nwomen. But multi-fetal pregnancies occur far more\\noften in women using fertility drugs.\\nPrecautions\\nBecause women or couples who use fertility drugs\\nhave made an extra effort to become pregnant, it is\\npossible that the individuals may be unwilling or\\nuncomfortable with the decision to abort a fetus in\\ncases of multi-fetal pregnancy. Individuals engaging in\\nfertility treatment should be made aware of the risk of\\nmulti-fetal pregnancy and consider the prospect of\\nrecommended reduction before undergoing fertility\\ntreatment.\\nDescription\\nSelective reduction is usually performed between\\nnine and 12 weeks of pregnancy and is most successful\\nwhen performed in early pregnancy. It is a simple\\nprocedure and can be performed on an outpatient\\nbasis. A needle is inserted into the woman’s stomach\\nor vagina and potassium chloride is injected into the\\nfetus.\\nPreparation\\nIndividuals who have chosen selective reduction\\nto safeguard the remaining fetuses should be coun-\\nseled prior to the procedure.

Odle\\nAbortion, spontaneous see Miscarriage\\nAbortion, therapeutic\\nDefinition\\nTherapeutic abortion is the intentional termina-\\ntion of apregnancy before the fetus can live indepen-\\ndently. Abortion has been a legal procedure in the\\nUnited States since 1973.\\nPurpose\\nAn abortion may be performed whenever there is\\nsome compelling reason to end a pregnancy. Women\\nhave abortions because continuing the pregnancy\\nwould cause them hardship, endanger their life or\\nhealth, or because prenatal testing has shown that\\nthe fetus will be born with severe abnormalities.\\nAbortions are safest when performed within the\\nfirst six to 10 weeks after the last menstrual period.\\nThe calculation of this date is referred to as the\\ngestational age and is used in determining the stage\\nof pregnancy. For example, a woman who is two\\nweeks late having her period is said to be six weeks\\npregnant, because it is six weeks since she last\\nmenstruated.\\nAbout 90% of women who have abortions do so\\nbefore 13 weeks and experience few complications.\\nAbortions performed between 13-24 weeks have a\\nhigher rate of complications. Abortions after 24\\nweeks are extremely rare and are usually limited to\\nsituations where the life of the mother is in danger.\\nPrecautions\\nMost women are able to have abortions at clinics\\nor outpatient facilities if the procedure is performed\\nearly in pregnancy. Women who have stable diabetes,\\ncontrolled epilepsy, mild to moderate high blood pres-\\nsure, or who are HIV positive can often have abortions\\nas outpatients if precautions are taken. Women with\\nheart disease, previousendocarditis, asthma,l u p u s\\nerythematosus, uterine fibroid tumors, blood clotting\\ndisorders, poorly controlled epilepsy, or some psycho-\\nlogical disorders usually need to be hospitalized in\\norder to receive special monitoring and medications\\nduring the procedure.\\nDescription\\nVery early abortions\\nBetween five and seven weeks, a pregnancy can be\\nended by a procedure called menstrual extraction.\\nThis procedure is also sometimes called menstrual\\nregulation, mini-suction, or preemptive abortion.\\nThe contents of the uterus are suctioned out through\\na thin (3-4 mm) plastic tube that is inserted through the\\nundilated cervix. Suction is applied either by a bulb\\nsyringe or a small pump.\\nAnother method is called the ‘‘morning after’’ pill,\\nor emergency contraception. Basically, it involves tak-\\ning high doses of birth control pills within 24 to 48\\nhours of having unprotected sex. The high doses of\\nhormones causes the uterine lining to change so that it\\nwill not support a pregnancy. Thus, if the egg has been\\nfertilized, it is simply expelled from the body.\\nThere are two types of emergencycontraception.\\nOne type is identical to ordinary birth control pills,\\nand uses the hormones estrogen and progestin). This\\ntype is available with a prescription under the brand\\nname Preven. But women can even use their regular\\nbirth control pills for emergency contraception, after\\nthey check with their doctor about the proper dose.\\nAbout half of women who use birth control pills for\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 9\\nAbortion, therapeutic'),\n",

It\\nreduces the risk of pregnancy 89 percent.\\nWomen should check with their physicians\\nregarding the proper dose of pills to take, as it depends\\non the brand of birth control pill. Not all birth control\\npills will work for emergency contraception.\\nMenstrual extractions are safe, but because the\\namount of fetal material is so small at this stage of\\ndevelopment, it is easy to miss. This results in an incom-\\nplete abortion that means the pregnancy continues.\\nFirst trimester abortions\\nThe first trimester of pregnancy includes the first\\n13 weeks after the last menstrual period. In the United\\nStates, about 90% of abortions are performed during\\nthis period. It is the safest time in which to have an\\nabortion, and the time in which women have the most\\nchoice of how the procedure is performed.\\nMEDICAL ABORTIONS.

Rh immune globulin\\n(RhoGAM) is a vaccine that must be given to a\\nwoman after an abortion, miscarriage, or prenatal\\ntests in order to prevent sensitization to Rh disease.\\n10 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\\nAbortion, therapeutic'),\n",

Methotrexate (Rheumatrex) works\\nby stopping fetal cells from dividing which causes the\\nfetus to die.\\nOn the first visit to the doctor, the woman receives\\nan injection of methotrexate. On the second visit,\\nabout a week later, she is given misoprostol\\n(Cytotec), an oxygenated unsaturated cyclic fatty\\nacid responsible for various hormonal reactions such\\nas muscle contraction (prostaglandin), that stimulates\\ncontractions of the uterus. Within two weeks, the\\nwoman will expel the contents of her uterus, ending\\nthe pregnancy. A follow-up visit to the doctor is neces-\\nsary to assure that the abortion is complete.\\nWith this procedure, a woman will feel cramping\\nand may feel nauseated from the misoprostol. This\\ncombination of drugs is 90-96% effective in ending\\npregnancy.\\nMifepristone (RU-486), which goes by the brand\\nname Mifeprex, works by blocking the action of pro-\\ngesterone, a hormone needed for pregnancy to con-\\ntinue, then stimulates ulerine contractions thus ending\\nthe pregnancy. It can be taken as much as 49 days after\\nthe first day of a woman’s last period. On the first visit\\nto the doctor, a woman takes a mifepristone pill. Two\\ndays later she returns and, if the miscarriage has not\\noccurred, takes two misoprostol pills, which causes the\\nuterus to contract. Five percent of women won’t need\\nto take misoprostol. After an observation period, she\\nreturns home.\\nWithin four days, 90% of women have expelled\\nthe contents of their uterus and completed the abor-\\ntion. Within 14 days, 95-97% of women have com-\\npleted the abortion. A third follow-up visit to the\\ndoctor is necessary to confirm through observation\\nor ultrasound that the procedure is complete. In the\\nevent that it is not, a surgical abortion is performed.\\nStudies show that 4.5 to 8 percent of women need\\nsurgery or a bloodtransfusion after taking mifepris-\\ntone, and the pregnancy persists in about 1 percent of\\nwomen. In this case, surgical abortion is recom-\\nmended because the fetus may be damanged. Side\\neffects include nausea, vaginal bleeding and heavy\\ncramping.

This may be done at\\nan office visit before the abortion or on the day of the\\nabortion. Some states require a waiting period before\\nan abortion can be performed. Others require parental\\nor court consent for a child under age 18 to receive an\\nabortion.\\nDespite the fact that almost half of all women\\nin the United States have had at least one abortion\\nby the time they reach age 45, abortion is surrounded\\nby controversy.

The doctor may prescribe\\nantibiotics to reduce the chance of infection. Women\\nwho are Rh negative (lacking genetically determined\\nantigens in their red blood cells that produce immune\\nresponses) should be given a human Rh immune\\nglobulin (RhoGAM) after the procedure unless the\\nfather of the fetus is also Rh negative. This prevents\\nblood incompatibility complications in future\\npregnancies.\\nBleeding will continue for about five days in a\\nsurgical abortion and longer in a medical abortion.\\nTo decrease the risk of infection, a woman should\\navoid intercourse and not use tampons and douches\\nfor two weeks after the abortion.\\nA follow-up visit is a necessary part of the\\nwoman’s aftercare.

It is the\\nresult of the body’s defensive reaction to foreign\\nmaterial.\\nDescription\\nThere are two types of abscesses, septic and sterile.\\nMost abscesses are septic, which means that they are\\nthe result of an infection. Septic abscesses can occur\\nanywhere in the body. Only a germ and the body’s\\nimmune response are required. In response to the\\ninvading germ, white blood cells gather at the infected\\nsite and begin producing chemicals called enzymes\\nthat attack the germ by digesting it. These enzymes\\nact like acid, killing the germs and breaking them\\ndown into small pieces that can be picked up by\\nthe circulation and eliminated from the body.\\nUnfortunately, these chemicals also digest body tis-\\nsues. In most cases, the germ produces similar chemi-\\ncals. The result is a thick, yellow liquid–pus–\\ncontaining digested germs, digested tissue, white\\nblood cells, and enzymes.\\nAn abscess is the last stage of a tissue infection\\nthat begins with a process called inflammation.\\nInitially, as the invading germ activates the body’s\\nimmune system, several events occur:\\n/C15Blood flow to the area increases.\\n/C15The temperature of the area increases due to the\\nincreased blood supply.\\n/C15The area swells due to the accumulation of water,\\nblood, and other liquids.\\n/C15It turns red.\\n/C15It hurts, because of the irritation from the swelling\\nand the chemical activity.\\nThese four signs–heat, swelling, redness, and\\npain–characterize inflammation.\\nAs the process progresses, the tissue begins to turn\\nto liquid, and an abscess forms. It is the nature of an\\nabscess to spread as the chemical digestion liquefies\\nmore and more tissue. Furthermore, the spreading\\nfollows the path of least resistance–the tissues most\\neasily digested. A good example is an abscess just\\nbeneath the skin. It most easily continues along\\nbeneath the skin rather than working its way through\\nthe skin where it could drain its toxic contents. The\\ncontents of the abscess also leak into the general cir-\\nculation and produce symptoms just like any other\\ninfection. These include chills,fever, aching, and\\ngeneral discomfort.\\nSterile abscesses are sometimes a milder form\\nof the same process caused not by germs but by non-\\nliving irritants such as drugs. If an injected drug\\nlike penicillin is not absorbed, it stays where it was\\nAn amoebic abscess caused by Entameoba histolytica .\\n(Phototake NYC.

Sterile abscesses are quite likely to turn into\\nhard, solid lumps as they scar, rather than remaining\\npockets of pus.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nMany different agents cause abscesses. The most\\ncommon are the pus-forming (pyogenic) bacteria like\\nStaphylococcus aureus, which is nearly always the\\ncause of abscesses under the skin. Abscesses near\\nthe large bowel, particularly around the anus, may\\nbe caused by any of the numerous bacteria found\\nwithin the large bowel. Brain abscesses and liver\\nabscesses can be caused by any organism that can\\ntravel there through the circulation. Bacteria,\\namoeba, and certain fungi can travel in this fashion.\\nAbscesses in other parts of the body are caused by\\norganisms that normally inhabit nearby structures or\\nthat infect them. Some common causes of specific\\nabscesses are:\\n/C15skin abscesses by normal skin flora\\n/C15dental and throat abscesses by mouth flora\\n/C15lung abscesses by normal airway flora,pneumonia\\ngerms, or tuberculosis\\n/C15abdominal and anal abscesses by normal bowel\\nflora\\nSpecific types of abscesses\\nListed below are some of the more common and\\nimportant abscesses.\\n/C15Carbuncles and otherboils. Skin oil glands (sebac-\\neous glands) on the back or the back of the neck\\nare the ones usually infected. The most common\\ngerm involved is Staphylococcus aureus . Acne is a\\nsimilar condition of sebaceous glands on the face\\nand back.\\n/C15Pilonidal abscess. Many people have as a birth defect\\na tiny opening in the skin just above the anus. Fecal\\nbacteria can enter this opening, causing an infection\\nand subsequent abscess.\\n/C15Retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, peritonsillar\\nabscess. As a result of throat infections like strep\\nthroat andtonsillitis, bacteria can invade the deeper\\ntissues of the throat and cause an abscess. These\\nabscesses can compromise swallowing and even\\nbreathing.\\n/C15Lung abscess. During or after pneumonia, whether\\nit’s due to bacteria [common pneumonia], tubercu-\\nlosis, fungi, parasites, or other germs, abscesses can\\ndevelop as a complication.\\n/C15Liver abscess. Bacteria or amoeba from the intestines\\ncan spread through the blood to the liver and cause\\nabscesses.\\n/C15Psoas abscess. Deep in the back of the abdomen on\\neither side of the lumbar spine lie the psoas muscles.\\nThey flex the hips. An abscess can develop in one of\\nthese muscles, usually when it spreads from the\\nappendix, the large bowel, or the fallopian tubes.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe common findings of inflammation–heat, red-\\nness, swelling, and pain–easily identify superficial\\nabscesses. Abscesses in other places may produce\\nonly generalized symptoms such as fever and discom-\\nfort. If the patient’s symptoms and physical examina-\\ntion do not help, a physician may have to resort to a\\nbattery of tests to locate the site of an abscess, but\\nusually something in the initial evaluation directs the\\nsearch. Recent or chronic disease in an organ suggests\\nit may be the site of an abscess. Dysfunction of an\\norgan or system–for instance, seizures or altered bowel\\nfunction–may provide the clue.Pain and tenderness\\non physical examination are common findings.\\nSometimes a deep abscess will eat a small channel\\n(sinus) to the surface and begin leaking pus.

Thus, the pus must be drained from the\\nabscess by a physician. The surgeon determines when\\nthe abscess is ready for drainage and opens a path to\\nthe outside, allowing the pus to escape. Ordinarily, the\\nbody handles the remaining infection, sometimes with\\nthe help ofantibiotics or other drugs. The surgeon may\\nleave a drain (a piece of cloth or rubber) in the abscess\\ncavity to prevent it from closing before all the pus has\\ndrained out.\\nAlternative treatment\\nIf an abscess is directly beneath the skin, it will be\\nslowly working its way through the skin as it is more\\nrapidly working its way elsewhere. Since chemicals\\nwork faster at higher temperatures, applications of\\nhot compresses to the skin over the abscess will hasten\\nthe digestion of the skin and eventually result in its\\nbreaking down, releasing the pus spontaneously. This\\ntreatment is best reserved for smaller abscesses in rela-\\ntively less dangerous areas of the body–limbs, trunk,\\nback of the neck. It is also useful for all superficial\\nabscesses in their very early stages. It will ‘‘ripen’’\\nthem.\\nContrast hydrotherapy, alternating hot and\\ncold compresses, can also help assist the body in\\nresorption of the abscess. There are two homeo-\\npathic remedies that work to rebalance the body in\\nrelation to abscess formation, Silica and Hepar\\nsulphuris . In cases of septic abscesses, bentonite\\nclay packs (bentonite clay and a small amount of\\nHydrastispowder) can be used to draw the infection\\nfrom the area.\\nPrognosis\\nOnce the abscess is properly drained, the prog-\\nnosis is excellent for the condition itself. The reason\\nfor the abscess (other diseases the patient has) will\\ndetermine the overall outcome.

In either\\ncase, the result is life threatening.

Turkington\\nAbuse\\nDefinition\\nAbuse is defined as anything that is harmful,\\ninjurious, or offensive. Abuse also includes excessive\\nand wrongful misuse of a substance. There are several\\nmajor types of abuse: physical and sexual abuse of a\\nchild or an adult,substance abuse, elderly abuse, and\\nemotional abuse.\\nDescription\\nPhysical abuse of a child is the infliction of injury\\nby another person. The injuries can include punching,\\nkicking, biting, burning, beating, or pulling the vic-\\ntim’s hair. The physical abuse inflicted on a child can\\nresult inbruises, burns, poisoning, broken bones, and\\ninternal hemorrhages. Physical assault against an\\nadult primarily occurs with women, usually in the\\nform of domestic violence. It is estimated that approxi-\\nmately three million children witness domestic vio-\\nlence every year.\\nSexual abuse of a child refers to sexual behavior\\nbetween an adult and child or between two children,\\none of whom is dominant or significantly older. The\\nsexual behaviors can include touching breasts, geni-\\ntals, and buttocks; either dressed or undressed. The\\nbehavior also can include exhibitionism, cunnilingus,\\nfellatio, or penetration of the vagina or anus with\\nsexual organs or objects.\\nPornographic photography also is used in sexual\\nabuse with children. Reported sex offenders are 97%\\nmale. Reports of child pornography have increased\\nsince with the popularity of the Internet. Females\\nmore often are perpetrators in child-care settings,\\nsince children may confuse sexual abuse by a female\\nwith normal hygiene care. The 1990s and early 2000s\\nwere rocked by reports of sexual abuse of children\\ncommitted by Catholic priests. Most of the abuse\\nappeared to have occurred during the 1970s and a\\nprominent report released early in 2004 stated that as\\nmany as 10.667 children were sexually abused by more\\nthan 4,300 priests. Sexual abuse by stepfathers is five\\ntimes more common than with biological fathers.\\nSexual abuse of daughters by stepfathers or fathers is\\nthe most common form of incest.\\nSexual abuse also can take the form ofrape. The\\nlegal definition of rape includes only slight penile\\npenetration in the victim’s outer vulva area.\\nComplete erection and ejaculation are not necessary.\\nRape is the perpetration of an act of sexual intercourse\\nwhether:\\n/C15will is overcome by force or fear (from threats or by\\nuse of drugs).\\n/C15mental impairment renders the victim incapable of\\nrational judgment.\\n/C15if the victim is below the legal age established for\\nconsent.\\nSubstance abuse is an abnormal pattern of sub-\\nstance usage leading to significant distress or impair-\\nment.

Elderly patients also may exhibit financial\\nabuse (money or possessions taken away) and\\nabandonment.\\nEmotional abuse generally continues even after\\nphysical assaults have stopped. In most cases it is a\\npersonally tailored form of verbal or gesture abuse\\nexpressed to illicit a provoked response.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nChildren who have been abused usually have a\\nvariety of symptoms that encompass behavioral, emo-\\ntional, and psychosomatic problems (body problems\\ncaused by emotional or mental disturbance). Children\\nwho have been physically abused tend to be more\\naggressive, angry, hostile, depressed, and have low\\nself-esteem. Additionally, they exhibit fear,anxiety,\\nand nightmares. Severe psychological problems may\\nresult in suicidal behavior or posttraumatic stress dis-\\norder. Physically abused children may complain of\\nphysical illness even in the absence of a cause. They\\nalso may suffer from eating disorders andencopresis,\\nor involuntary defecation caused or psychic origin.\\nChildren who are sexually abused may exhibit abnor-\\nmal sexual behavior in the form of aggressiveness and\\nhyperarousal. Adolescents may display promiscuity,\\nsexual acting out, and—in some situations—homo-\\nsexual contact.\\nPhysical abuse directed towards adults can ulti-\\nmately lead todeath. Approximately 50% of women\\nmurdered in the United States were killed by a former\\nor current male partner. Approximately one-third of\\nemergency room consultations by women were\\nprompted due to domestic violence. Female victims\\nwho are married also have a higher rate of internal\\ninjuries and unconsciousness than victims of stranger\\nassault (mugging, robbery). Physical abuse or rape\\nalso can occur between married persons and persons\\nof the same gender. Perpetrators usually sexually\\nassault their victims to dominate, hurt, and debase\\nthem. It is common for physical and sexual violence\\nto occur at the same time. A large percentage of sexu-\\nally assaulted persons were also physically abused in\\nthe form of punching, beating, or threatening the vic-\\ntim with a weapon such as a gun or knife. Usually\\nmales who are hurt and humiliated tend to physically\\nassault people whom they are intimately involved\\nwith, such as spouses and/or children. Males who\\nassault a female tend to have experienced or witnessed\\nviolence during childhood. They also tend to abuse\\nalcohol, to be sexually assaultive, and are at increased\\nrisk for assaultive behavior directed against children.\\nJealous males tend to monitor a women’s movements\\nand whereabouts and to isolate other sources of pro-\\ntection and support. They interpret their behavior as\\nbetrayal of trust and this causes resentment and explo-\\nsive anger outbursts during periods of losing control.\\nMales also may use aggression against females in an\\neffort to control and intimidate partners.\\nAbuse in the elderly usually occurs in the frail,\\nelderly community. The caretaker is usually the perpe-\\ntrator. Caretaker abuse can be suspected if there is\\nevidence suggesting behavioral changes in the elderly\\nperson when the caretaker is present.

Injuries are visible\\nby inspection or self-report. Physical abuse of an adult\\nmay also be evident by inspection with visible cuts\\nand/or bruises or self-report.\\nSexual abuse of both a child and an adult can be\\ndiagnosed with a history from the victim.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine.pdf', 'page': 49}, page_content='Description\\nThis drug is available without a prescription.\\nAcetaminophen is sold under various brand names,\\nincluding Tylenol, Panadol,Aspirin Free Anacin, and\\nBayer Select Maximum StrengthHeadache Pain Relief\\nFormula. Many multi-symptom cold, flu, and sinus\\nmedicines also contain acetaminophen. The ingredi-\\nents listing on the container should state if acetamino-\\nphen is included in the product.\\nStudies have shown that acetaminophen relieves\\npain and reduces fever about as well as aspirin. But\\ndifferences between these two common drugs exist.\\nAcetaminophen is less likely than aspirin to irritate\\nthe stomach. However, unlike aspirin, acetaminophen\\ndoes not reduce the redness, stiffness, or swelling that\\naccompany arthritis.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe usual dosage for adults and children age 12\\nand over is 325-650 mg every four to six hours as\\nneeded. No more than 4 grams (4000 mg) should be\\ntaken in 24 hours. Because the drug can potentially\\nharm the liver, people who drink alcohol in large\\nquantities should take considerably less acetamino-\\nphen and possibly should avoid the drug completely.\\nFor children ages 6-11 years, the usual dose is 150-\\n300 mg, three to four times a day. A physician should\\nrecommend doses for children under age 6 years.\\nPrecautions\\nIn 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\\n(FDA) launched an advertising campaign aimed at\\neducating consumers about proper use of acetamino-\\nphen and other over-the-counter pain killers. Often,\\nacetaminophen is hidden in many cold and flu products\\nand people unexpectedly overdose on the medicine.\\nSome cases have led toliver transplantationor death.\\nMore than the recommended dosage of acetaminophen\\nshould not be taken unless told to do so by a physician\\nor dentist.\\nPatients should not use acetaminophen for more\\nthan 10 days to relieve pain (five days for children) or\\nfor more than three days to reduce fever, unless direc-\\nted to do so by a physician. If symptoms do not go\\naway—or if they get worse— a physician should be\\ncontacted. Anyone who drinks three or more alcoholic\\nbeverages a day should check with a physician before\\nusing this drug and should never take more than the\\nrecommended dosage. A risk of liver damage exists\\nfrom combining large amounts of alcohol and\\nacetaminophen. People who already have kidney or\\nliver diseaseor liver infections should also consult with\\na physician before using the drug. So should women\\nwho are pregnant or breastfeeding.\\nMany drugs can interact with one another. A\\nphysician or pharmacist should be consulted before\\ncombining acetaminophen with any other medicine.\\nTwo different acetaminophen-containing products\\nshould not be used at the same time.\\nAcetaminophen interferes with the results of some\\nmedical tests. Avoiding the drug for a few days before\\nthe tests may be necessary.\\nSide effects\\nAcetaminophen causes few side effects. The most\\ncommon one is lightheadedness. Some people may\\nexperience trembling and pain in the side or the\\nlower back. Allergic reactions occur in some people,\\nbut are rare. Anyone who develops symptoms such as\\na rash, swelling, or difficulty breathing after taking\\nacetaminophen should stop taking the drug and get\\nimmediate medical attention. Other rare side effects\\ninclude yellow skin or eyes, unusual bleeding or bruis-\\ning, weakness,fatigue, bloody or black stools, bloody\\nor cloudy urine, and a sudden decrease in the amount\\nof urine.\\nOverdoses of acetaminophen may causenausea,\\nvomiting, sweating, and exhaustion. Very large over-\\ndoses can cause liver damage. In case of an overdose,\\nimmediate medical attention should be sought. In\\n2004, researchers announced that an injection to coun-\\nteract the liver injury caused by acetaminophen over-\\ndose has been approved by the FDA.\\nInteractions\\nAcetaminophen may interact with a variety of\\nother medicines. When this happens, the effects of one\\nor both of the drugs may change or the risk of side\\neffects may be greater. Among the drugs that may\\ninteract with acetaminophen are alcohol, nonsteroidal\\nKEY TERMS\\nArthritis— Inflammation of the joints.
